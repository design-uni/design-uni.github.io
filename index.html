        <h1>Reflections on Recent Events</h1>
        <p>A Democratic space is created with an acquiescence to an active acceptance. It is a creation of a spatio-temporality that is participative, without the imposition of an immanent conversational hierarchy. </p>
        <p>Subliminal imposition of rules on a space is a well studied phenomenon, where collective complicity is an accepted truism. Conformity with the ideal of equalization of textual hermeneutics is taken too far, when there is an expectation of conformity to standards that are patriarch-esque in their delivery. They are not an invitation to participation, but an invitation to participate in moral policing. They are not a show of strength, but a show of institutional fragility. </p>
        <p>The corruption of a space of engagement, whether intellectual or not, whether an expression of youthful-playfullness or not, requires the will to generalize, uniformize, in a fear of liability. The act of protection of the collective, becomes an act of self-protection, the self here being the abstract institution. In truth, the resolution of legal readings aside, a visceral feeling of fear comes about, an undertone of radical fear, anger and suspicion, and a will to militancy that is needlessly confrontational, and yet an obvious outpouring of counter-energy, a necessary outpouring in the face of a will to control, surveil, curtail and silence.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this polemic will be viewed as an untoward outcry, a needless expression of discontent. Discontent needn't be specific, or general. It can be an intermeshing of both. While it is important to note the unprecedented violence of recent events, we need to give a nod to the general atmosphere of discontent, sufficiently justified. This is caused by the subliminality we argued for before.</p>
        <p>An organization of voice is markedly important in the face of adversity. However, subliminal changes can be combatted with a stronger subliminal force - the force of daily practice of beliefs that aim to merely uphold the beliefs of others. An organization such as our university, that holds the promise of new-thought simply cannot be complicit is violence justified by the will to discipline, an iron-fist, or a cowboy's whip, meant only for the hands of colonial suppressors in our history books. </p>
        <p>We must remind the reader that the re-codification of the student handbook is only an extension of a thought-climate that we all feel. It is a feeling that creates a perceptual-space inhabited by people with pale faces, with perpetual wide-eyed horror, facing off with frowns, and more horrifyingly, warm smiles, with a false warmth that promises protection and belonging at the cost of conformity. It is important to speak up. It is important to speak up. </p>
        <p>The acts of de-humanizing students aren't new to student bodies across the country. In fact the act itself is adrenaline filled, hedonistic, self-feeding, and difficult to stop. The act of protest is not a counter to that. It is rather a brilliant welcome sign for an attempt to prevent the self-feeding process for anger-begets-discontent-begets-violence-begets-anger, and so on. Protest comes with the promise of an alternative, not in debate, but as humans: standing up to their own de-humanization. </p>
